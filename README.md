# User Identification using Keystroke Dynamics
Made in the Smart India Hackathon for the Indian Space Research Organisation, my team built a web app that records keystrokes of a user to create a dataset capturing his/her typing style.

The web app uses a two-step verification system with phone OTP verification and the backend used a Generative Adverserial Neural Network running on Django.

## Tech Stack
- **Django Backend**
- **HTML, CSS and Bootstrap**
- **Generative Adverserial Neural Network to identify fraudulent users trying to sign in**
- **2 step verification with phone OTP verification**
